    <h1>About CyberOptix</h1>
    <p> <strong>Your Trusted Partner in Tech Empowerment</strong> <br>Welcome to CyberOptix, Myanmar‚Äôs trusted online store for premium laptops, accessories, and digital essentials. Designed by students, for the people, CyberOptix is more than just an e-commerce platform‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement to make technology accessible, affordable, and reliable for everyone in Myanmar.</p>
    
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>CyberOptix was born in 2024 as part of a special project by students of the Myanmar Institute of Information Technology (MIIT). Inspired by a vision to bridge the tech gap in our local communities, we transformed a university initiative into a full-fledged startup aimed at modernizing the way people shop for laptops.<br>What started in a small student lab is now an expanding digital marketplace committed to simplifying the laptop-buying experience across Mandalay, Yangon and beyond.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>‚ÄúTo become Myanmar‚Äôs most trusted gateway to global technology, bridging quality and affordability.‚Äù</p>

      <li>Deliver cutting-edge devices with verified international warranties</li>
      <li>Simplify tech imports through MIIT-supported logistics</li>

</p>
    <h2>We‚Äôre Not Perfect (Yet!)</h2>

    <p>As a young, growing startup, we believe in transparency. Here's where we‚Äôre still improving:</p><br>
    <p> -Smaller Inventory on Rare Models<br>
    Since we work with limited warehousing, some high-end or ultra-niche laptops may run out fast. But we‚Äôre actively working to expand our catalog and offer pre-orders.</p>

    <p>   -Occasional Delivery Delays<br>
     While we aim for fast shipping, some remote regions may face slight delays due to courier limitations. We‚Äôre working closely with logistics partners to improve this.
</p>
 <p>  -Limited Payment Flexibility<br>
    Currently, we accept major cards, PayPal, and mobile wallets. We‚Äôre actively developing more local-friendly options like bank transfers and installment plans.</p>

    <h2>Our Promise</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Genuine Products </strong>‚Äì All laptops are sourced from trusted distributors with valid warranties.
    </p><br>
