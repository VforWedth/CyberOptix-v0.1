 About this item
   
    - READY FOR ANYTHING - Jump right into the action with Windows 11, an AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS CPU, and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU at 140W Max TGP.
    - SWIFT MEMORY AND STORAGE – Multitask faster with 16GB of DDR5-4800MHz memory and speed up loading times with 1TB of PCIe 4x4.
    - NEVER MISS A MOMENT – Keep up with the pros thanks to its fast FHD 144Hz display with 100% sRGB color. Adaptive sync tech reduces lag, minimizes stuttering, and eliminates visual tearing for ultra-smooth and lifelike gameplay.
    - BLOW AWAY THE COMPETITION – The TUF is equipped to handle its high-power CPU with a pair of 84-blade Arc Flow Fans which improves cooling performance without extra noise.
    - MUX SWITCH WITH ADVANCED OPTIMUS - A MUX Switch increases laptop gaming performance by 5-10% by routing frames directly from the dGPU to the display bypassing the iGPU. With Advanced Optimus the switch between iGPU and dGPU becomes automatic based on the task, optimizing battery life.
