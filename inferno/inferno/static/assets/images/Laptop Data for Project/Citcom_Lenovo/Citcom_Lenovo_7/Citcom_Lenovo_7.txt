About this item

    - Released in early 2024, Lenovo’s 12th generation of the flagship ThinkPad X1 Carbon is a powerhouse of performance boosting features in an ultrathin and ultralight form factor. Gen 12 X1 Carbon updates include Intel’s 14th-gen Meteor Lake Core Ultra processors bringing improved graphics performance, stronger multi-core performance, AI capabilities, and greater power efficiency without sacrificing performance.
    - Unopened retail packaging, sold as configured by Lenovo. One Year Onsite Lenovo Warranty. Add up to 5 years of Lenovo Premier Support when you register your computer with Lenovo.
    - Manufactured with recycled carbon fiber, the X1 Carbon Gen 12 incorporates recycled materials from front to back. The top, bottom, keyboard, and even the battery back all include recycled materials. Bio-based materials like bamboo and sugarcane are integrated into the laptop packaging, ensuring it is 100% rapidly renewable.
    - The updated keyboard includes tactile bumps on some of the keys, making it easier for touch typists. The revised 120mm glass touchpad is larger than the last one (110mm) and still includes the familiar ThinkPad buttons at the top. Other changes include a slightly smaller form factor, thinner bezels providing a 5% higher screen-to-body ratio and it’s even lighter, just 2.41 pounds without the charger!
    - A full HD webcam, dual-microphone array, and stereo speakers allow for easy video conferencing while working on the go. With a range of ports, including two USB-C/Thunderbolt 4, two USB-A 3.2, and HDMI ports, connect multiple peripherals as well as experience faster downloads and quick file transfers. Minimal preloaded applications mean maximum battery life and responsiveness for users, and faster deployment for IT admins.
    - Double tapping the TrackPoint pointing stick in the middle of the keyboard brings up a Quick Menu that controls settings for the microphone, choosing your output device, and using your voice to type into a text box.
    - Eyesafe Certified: Always-on blue light protection for decreased fatigue and eye-strain increases your ability to work longer hours and meet important deadlines.

    - Intel vPro is a validated platform with built-in features for performance, hardware-based security, manageability, and stability. Intel vPro offers multilayer security out of the box and remote management capabilities so IT can better support users from anywhere.
    - As always, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12 has gone through multiple testing procedures. Whether you’re in the middle of the desert during a dust storm or in the Alaskan wilderness, the ThinkPad has been tested for extreme high and low temperatures as well as sand and dust. Other tests include: mechanical shock, vibration, shipboard vibration, humidity, fungus, explore atmosphere, altitude and solar radiation.
