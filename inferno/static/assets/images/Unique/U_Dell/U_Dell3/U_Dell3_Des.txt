 About this item

    LOOKING GOOD: A thoughtful design thatâ€™s finished in a classic color. The three-side narrow bezel enhances views, while still fitting in your bag.
    ALL DAY ANY DAY: Work in comfort on your 15.6 inch laptop thanks to a lift hinge that raises your device to an ergonomic angle, which provides a more comfortable typing angle.
    EVERYDAY CONSIDERATIONS: Designed to last through regular use, with tiny rubber feet and bumpers on the hinge that keep it from skidding and provide additional stability when on hard surfaces.
    REDUCE THE STRAIN: Dell ComfortView Low Blue Light Software solutions help reduce harmful blue light emissions and optimize eye comfort over extended periods of screen time.
    A SECOND LIFE: Incorporating the use of post-consumer recycled plastics, these laptops take a step towards being environmentally friendly and sustainable, helping to keep plastics out of landfills.
